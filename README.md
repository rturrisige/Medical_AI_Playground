# Medical AI: Playground

This repository contains Python notebooks aiming to provide
some hands-on tutorials
to practice Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) in the healthcare field.

The notebooks have been created by Rosanna Turrisi (rosanna.turrisi@edu.unige.it) for students and young 
researchers that want to approach to Medical AI.

## Notebooks

- `Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb`:
  The goal of this notebook is to get familiar
  with some standard unsupervised analysis.
  A clustering method is applied to group genomic data.
  

- `Predictive_Machine_Learning.ipynb`
  The goal of this notebook is to get familiar with
  supervised learning. A machine learning classifier is built to
  address a binary classification problem on clinical data.
  Specifically, the model is applied to a diagnosis problem.
  

- `Predictive_Deep_Learning.ipynb`
  The goal of this notebook is to get familiar with some basic models
  of Deep Learning (DL). Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network
  is implemented to perform a tumor classification,
  based on skin cancer images.
  

- `Feature_selection.ipynb`
  The goal of this notebook is to understand the importance of feature selection
  and how to perform it. Three main approaches to feature selection are implemented
  and compared, that are Filter methods, Recursive Feature Elimination, Regularization methods. 
  The employed dataset is a genomic dataset including about 2k features.
  

- `AIM_pipeline.ipynb`

    The goal of this notebook is to have a practical insight of
  a Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) pipeline. 
  It performs tumor classification based on genomic data passing through 
  data loading, data analysis and processing, and feature selection.
